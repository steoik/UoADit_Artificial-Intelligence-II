### Assignment  
In this homework you have to develop a sentiment classifier for the dataset imdb-reviews.csv of Homeworks 1 and 2 using a bidirectional stacked RNNs with LSTM/GRU cells. For the development of the models, you can experiment with the number of stacked RNNs, the number of hidden layers, type of cells, skip connections, gradient clipping and dropout probability. Use the Adam optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function. The inputs to your model must be GloVe word embeddings (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). It is expected that you will experiment with more than one neural network architecture to choose the best for the problem.
