### Assignment  
In this homework you have to develop a sentiment classifier using logistic regression for the dataset imdb-reviews.csv which is provided. Each row in the dataset contains a URL for an IMDb movie (https://www.imdb.com/), a score between 0.0 and 10.0 and a review text. Your classifier should deal with 2 classes: negative sentiment (score between 0.0 and 4.0) and positive sentiment (score between 7.0 and 10.0). There are no reviews with intermediate scores in the dataset.
